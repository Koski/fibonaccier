# Fibonaccier

This simple python program consists of a main which takes a positive integer command line input and calculates the Fibonacci number denoted by the given input number.

Note that at least on the author's machine the maximum number with which the program works is 984. Any number after that results in recursion error of max depth.

### Prequisite

The programs has been verified to work with Python version 3.9.8. Later versions might work as well but not guaranteed.

### Usage
Example

`python3 main.py 10`

Should print a message as follows

_#10 Fibonacci number is 55. Function call number x finished first._ 

(x depends on your luck. Running the main multiple times should yield different x values)
